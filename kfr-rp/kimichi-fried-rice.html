                Growing up, my favorite nights were the ones when my mom didn't feel like cooking, because I knew there was a 90-percent chance dinner would involve kimchi, our family's favorite shortcut to flavorful meals. Some nights, we'd do kimchi stew with lots of soft tofu. Other nights, we'd tuck into chilled somen noodles with chopped raw kimchi and toasted sesame oil. But my favorite nights were the ones of endless bowls of kimchi fried rice cooked in plenty of oil with sizzling pieces of—what else?—Spam. My mom always cooked her fried rice until a layer of spicy, crispy rice—call it Korean soccarat—formed on the bottom of the pan. And damn, it was good.

                Heat a glug of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, then add a handful of chopped kimchi with its juice. Cook until kimchi is softened, about three minutes, then add a big handful of torn leafy greens (I like Tuscan kale or Swiss chard), a cup of cooked grains, and a splash of water. Cover skillet with a lid and cook for a minute or two, until greens are wilted and grains are warmed through. Stir in some soy sauce, rice vinegar, and a bit of toasted sesame oil to taste. Top with a fried egg if you're feeling fancy. A spoonful of sambal oelek never hurt, either.
