                Growing up, my favorite nights were the ones when my mom didn't feel like cooking, because I knew there was a 90-percent chance dinner would involve kimchi, our family's favorite shortcut to flavorful meals. Some nights, we'd do kimchi stew with lots of soft tofu. Other nights, we'd tuck into chilled somen noodles with chopped raw kimchi and toasted sesame oil. But my favorite nights were the ones of endless bowls of kimchi fried rice cooked in plenty of oil with sizzling pieces of—what else?—Spam. My mom always cooked her fried rice until a layer of spicy, crispy rice—call it Korean soccarat—formed on the bottom of the pan. And damn, it was good.
